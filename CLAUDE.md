# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a homework repository for CS 530: Geometric and Probabilistic Methods for Computer Scientists at the University of New Mexico (Fall 2025). The course focuses on applied mathematics including information theory, linear systems theory, and mathematical modeling for computer science applications.

## Structure

- `homework_*/` - Individual homework assignment directories containing Jupyter notebooks
- Each homework directory contains numbered problem notebooks (e.g., `problem_2.ipynb`)

## Working with Notebooks

This repository primarily uses Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) for mathematical computations and algorithm implementations.

**Key Tools:**
- Use the `NotebookEdit` tool to modify notebook cells
- Use the `mcp__ide__executeCode` tool to run Python code in the Jupyter kernel
- Use the standard `Read` tool to examine notebook contents

**Notebook Workflow:**
- Problems are implemented as individual cells within numbered problem notebooks
- Mathematical content often includes LaTeX equations and algorithmic implementations
- Focus on numerical methods, iterative algorithms, and mathematical modeling

## Development Environment

This repository does not use traditional package managers (no package.json, requirements.txt, etc.). The computational work is done directly in Jupyter notebooks with standard Python scientific libraries.
